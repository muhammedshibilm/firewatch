## About FireWatch  

**FireWatch** is a web-based application built using Django and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect fire and smoke from images. This project enables users to upload images, preview them, and even use live capture features for real-time fire detection.  

---

## Features  

âœ… **User Authentication** â€“ Secure user registration and login system.  
âœ… **Image Upload & Preview** â€“ Easily upload images for fire detection analysis.  
âœ… **Live Capture View** â€“ Get real-time fire and smoke detection via webcam or connected cameras.  
âœ… **CNN-Based Detection** â€“ Uses deep learning models to analyze images and detect fire/smoke.  
âœ… **Django-Powered Backend** â€“ Robust and scalable framework for web applications.

## Installation & Setup  

Follow these steps to get FireWatch up and running on your local machine.  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/firewatch.git  
cd firewatch  
```  

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment  
Itâ€™s recommended to use a **Python virtual environment** to manage dependencies.  

```sh
python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment  
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate (Mac/Linux)  
venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate (Windows)  
```  

### 3. Setup Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:  
```sh
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here  
DEBUG=True  
```  

### 4. Install Dependencies  
Ensure you're in the virtual environment, then install required packages:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 5. Apply Database Migrations  
Run the following commands to set up the database:  
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations  
python manage.py migrate  
```  

### 6. Run the Development Server  
Start the Django server using:  
```sh
python manage.py runserver  
```  

The app will now be available at **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**.

## Usage  

1. **Open FireWatch** in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)  
2. **Register or log in** with an existing account.  
3. **Upload an image** to check for fire or smoke.  
4. **Use the live capture feature** for real-time fire detection.

This version now clearly mentions the use of `venv` for environment isolation. Let me know if you need any more refinements! ðŸš€
